\# NLP Project – Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis



\##  Overview

This project performs multi-class sentiment analysis on Yelp restaurant reviews using Transformer-based models. The goal is to classify reviews into five sentiment categories corresponding to star ratings (1–5).



\##  Dataset

\- Yelp Review Full Dataset (Hugging Face)

\- ~650k training samples, ~50k test samples

\- Labels: 1-star to 5-star



\##  Model

\- RoBERTa-base (fine-tuned)

\- Multi-class classification (5 classes)



\## 🔧 Workflow

1\. Data Exploration

2\. Text Preprocessing

3\. Model Training (with subsampling due to CPU constraints)

4\. Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)



\##  Results

\- Accuracy: ~62%

\- Weighted F1-score: ~0.62

\- Strong performance on extreme sentiment classes
